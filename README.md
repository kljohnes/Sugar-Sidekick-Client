# SUGAR SIDEKICK CLIENT

## DEPLOYED URL: https://sugar-sidekick-client.herokuapp.com/


### Sugar Sidekick is an app designed to make the management of diabetes just a little bit easier. Users can log various events, such as blood glucose readings, carbs consumed, and insulin doses. In addition, they can keep track of their prescriptions for medications and devices. Both of these features utilize full CRUD capabilities. Users can also create profiles. In the future, they will be able to edit profiles and passwords.

### This app also features a carb calculator powered by the Edamam API. Users can input up to 6 different foods at a time and calculate the total carb count.

### This app features role-based access control. At this point, only an Admin can register users. This is due to the nature of the app (medical data), and the fact that it is still in development. Access is restricted for security reasons. Users can currently access the contact form and request registration. The code for users to create accounts has been written and is included in this repository, but it isn't active on the client side at this time.

## To test the features of the app, you can use the test user:
    email: user@email.com
    password: password
